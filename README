WHAT IS IT
==========
An example to instrument a method using 'javassist' library.
Official site : http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/
You can also check their github page at https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist

WHY
===
To modify method behavior/code during compile time.

WHEN TO USE IT
==============
I would suggest not to. It is better to take some effort to refactor the method or class to get the desired result.
But when it is inevitable, there is a way. You can always instrument the method.

ARE THERE OTHER LIBRARIES
=========================
Yes. You can try ASM (http://asm.ow2.org/index.html)

HOW TO EXECUTE
==============
cd <to project directory>
cd <to bin dir>
jar cvfm instrumentation.jar ..\meta-inf\manifest.mf .
java -cp .;./../lib/javassist-3.14.0-GA.jar -javaagent:./instrumentation.jar com.sasanka.a.TestClassToBeInstrumented

Here method1() is instrumented. 
So rather than printing what is in the method's print statement, it prints the updated print statement as per TransformerClass.
